Tutorial for using RANS with sedInterFoam (Simulation of the experimental configuration from Dohmen-Janssen and Hanes 2002)

/!\ swak4Foam needs to be installed to use command funkySetField /!\

1) Mesh creation:
- blockMesh
- snappyHexMesh -overwrite (better run in parallel)
- extrudeMesh

2) Rename patch for 2D case:
- replace "emptyy" by "empty" in file "constant/polyMesh/boundary" for patches "cfrontWall" and "cbackWall"

3) Initialize fields:
- cp -r 0_org 0
- funkySetFields -time 0
- setWaveField

4) Replace alpha.water and U (needed to initialize the fields with waves2Foam) by gamma and U.flu (used in sedInterFoam)
- mv 0/alpha.water 0/gamma
- mv 0/U 0/U.flu

The case is ready to be decomposed and run in parallel
