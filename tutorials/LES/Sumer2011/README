Tutorial for using LES with sedInterFoam (Simulation of the experimental configuration from Sumer et al. 2011)

/!\ swak4Foam needs to be installed to use command funkySetField /!\

1) Mesh creation:
- blockMesh
- snappyHexMesh -overwrite (better run in parallel)

2) Initialize fields:
- cp -r 0_org 0
- funkySetFields -time 0
- setWaveField

3) Replace alpha.water and U (needed to initialize the fields with waves2Foam) by gamma and U.flu (used in sedInterFoam)
- mv 0/alpha.water 0/gamma
- mv 0/U 0/U.flu

The case is ready to be decomposed and run in parallel
